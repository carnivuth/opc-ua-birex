## Connection keys and certificates problems

The function:

```python
client.set_security_string("Aes128Sha256RsaOaep,SignAndEncrypt,certs/own/uaexpert.der,certs/own/uaexpert_key.pem,certs/server/nikonslm.birex.der")
```

Needs the certificate files inside the certs dir as follows:

```text
certs
├── own
│   ├── uaexpert.der
│   └── uaexpert_key.pem
└── server
    └── nikonslm.birex.der
```

## `application_uri` variable problems

The library present itself with a default application uri wich is not suited for certificates generated by uaexpert client, the script changes the variable value to:

```python
client.application_uri= f'urn:{socket.gethostname()}:UnifiedAutomation:UaExpert'
```
